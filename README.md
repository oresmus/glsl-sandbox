Online live editor for fragment shaders.

Forked for experimentation.

Can be run locally in a silly way (but it works, with no db, just for live editing the single example shader):

    % cd static
    % jekyll serve

(Of course this only works if you already have jekyll. This is not using jekyll except as a static web server -- any other basic server would probably do just as well.)
